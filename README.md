1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve):**
   - Process Order: P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P4
   - Average Waiting Time: 31.25
   - Average Turnaround Time: 57.5

2. **SJF (Shortest Job First):**
   - Process Order: P1 -> P4 -> P2 -> P3
   - Average Waiting Time: 23.75
   - Average Turnaround Time: 50.0

3. **Priority Scheduling:**
   - Process Order: P1 -> P2 -> P4 -> P3
   - Average Waiting Time: 25.0
   - Average Turnaround Time: 51.25

**Analysis:**
- In terms of **average waiting time**, SJF provides the lowest average waiting time.
- In terms of **average turnaround time**, SJF also provides the lowest average turnaround time.
- FCFS has the highest average waiting time and turnaround time among the three.

Hence, SJF (Shortest Job First) appears to provide the most fair and efficient scheduling for these processes. It minimizes both waiting time and turnaround time, making it a good choice for a busy hospital room scenario where efficiency is a priority.
